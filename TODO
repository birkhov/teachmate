This is a list of enhancements and features that is suggested to implement by the community.
You can make up your own feature and work on it, but before that
please check through this list -- you might find something you'd like to work on.

Please send suggestions and comments to my email published here: http://snitko.ru

Note, there are two sections: "enhancements" and "features".

== ENHANCEMENTS

  * Sorting search results by the time a tag is added *
    Currently search is implemented in way that it sorts people it finds by the
    time they signed up for TeachMate. This is okay, but still slightly wrong.
    The good way would be to sort them by the time they created the tag that is mentioned
    in the search request.

  * Location autofill option *
    Some people complained they didn't like autofilling their location in search form.
    Probably we should do two things here:
    1) Put a checkbox in the profile create/edit form near the location field that asks if
    the user wants to autofill those fields in search form.
    2) Put a simple button/link that autofills/removes location from search fields.

  * Hint that pops up if user types a tag that is too long *
    Totally a javascript/html task. Some people think tags delimiters are spaces,
    so when they input their tags, they become really long. What's even worse is that nobody's
    ever going to find them. That's why we need a little jQuery code to show a hint, when user
    inputs, say, a tag of more than 20 characters. And, of course, a hint should jus say
    something like "Are you sure this tag is really that long? Separate tags with commas (,) please!"
    Showing hints feature and html-block for hints are already inplemented, see 
    //hints section of 'application.js' and an example of hint block in 'app/views/static/index.erb'.

  * Allow <a> and <img> tags in more_info in profile *

  * Loading comments in user profile with ajax *
    For now comments simply are loaded on on profile page anytime,
    but are hidden until you click "Show comments". The smart thing would be to load them
    with ajax.

  * "Subscribe" button with ajax *
    If you click "subscribe" button in search results when you're logged in,
    the page is reloaded and then a message is displayed in place of the button.
    We need to extend this behavior with the ajax-like, leaving page reloading for
    the cases when javascript is turned off.

== FEATURES

    * Bookmarking User *
    TeachMate needs a simple tool to save users you like and might want to contact
    in future. "Friending" seems like a too complicated and wrong concept. It would be
    a good idea to just have a small ajax-link in profile that adds people to "bookmarks".
    And, therefore, there should be a small (like "managing subscriptions") to edit
    these bookmarks.
    
    * Social networks links in profile *
    Personally, I think it's a crap, but people like that stuff. So probably, we need fields in
    create/edit profile to fill in social network accounts. I think small buttons with logos
    and fields sliding down is the best way to do that.
