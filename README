  2. git submodule update
  3. mv config/_database.rb config/database.rb

     If you're using Rails 2.1.2 you will need rspec 1.1.11
     If you're using Rails 2.0.2 i can tell you it wokred fine with rspec 1.1.4

== CONTRIBUTING

  * If you're planning to add or enhance a feature please check through TODO first.
  * When implementing, please make sure you write specs for your code.
    I do not accept models/controllers/lib code without specs or at least regular tests for it.
  * If you have any suggestions or questions you can find my contacts at http://snitko.ru

  * You can contribute by just posting about TeachMate in your blog.
    TeachMate could become extremely useful for people as it gets more users from all over the world.
