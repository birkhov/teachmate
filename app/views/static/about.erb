  <h1>What teachmate is all about?</h1>

  <p>The idea behind this service is simple: <strong>whoever teaches &mdash; learns</strong>. There are few simple things we wish our user could find out:
    <ul>
      <li class="green">You don't need to be a professional to teach. Instead, you have to teach to become a professional.</li>
      <li>You don't need to pay money for learning or ask for money when you teach someone.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
